# Currently, without tickless kernel, the SYSCOUNTER value after the software
# reset is not set properly and due to that the first system interrupt is not called
# in the proper time - the SYSCOUNTER value is set to the value from before
# reset + 1. Hence, the reboot time increases more and more.
# To avoid it enable tickles kernel for mcuboot.
