	   The minimum Bluetooth security level means that the bridged devices using this or a higher level will be
	   allowed to connect to the bridge. The level cannot be set to a value smaller than 2, as it would mean that
	   the communication with the connected devices will not be encrypted, what is not considered to be secure.
