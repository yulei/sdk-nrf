Releases and maturity
#####################

The |NCS| receives regular releases, which introduce new components or fix issues in existing features, according to the criteria for :ref:`versions and revisions <dm-revisions>`.
Each new release comes with its own :ref:`release_notes` and can also change the :ref:`software_maturity` of the existing components.

If an issue is found in a release after it has taken place, those issues are listed on the :ref:`known_issues` page.
