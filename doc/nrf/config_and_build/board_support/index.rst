Board support
#############

The |NCS| provides board definitions for all Nordic Semiconductor devices.
These are in tables on the :ref:`app_boards_names` page, listed by :ref:`app_boards_names_zephyr`, :ref:`app_boards_names_nrf`, and :ref:`shield_names_nrf`.

Some boards can support Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), which results in separation of :ref:`app_boards_spe_nspe`.

In addition, you can :ref:`define custom boards <defining_custom_board>`.
