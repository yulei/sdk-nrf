This Matter bridge application demonstrates the usage of the :ref:`Matter <ug_matter>` application layer to build a bridge device.
Such a device allows the use of non-Matter devices in a :ref:`Matter fabric <ug_matter_network_topologies_structure>` by exposing them as Matter endpoints.
The device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of a low-power 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) network.
You can use this application as a reference for creating your own application.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

To commission the bridge device and control it remotely through a Wi-Fi network, you also need a Matter controller device :ref:`configured on PC or smartphone <ug_matter_configuring>`.
This requires additional hardware depending on your setup.

.. note::
    |matter_gn_required_note|

Overview
********

The application uses buttons to control the device state and a single LED to show the state of a device.
The bridge has capability of representing non-Matter bridged devices as a dynamic endpoints.
The application supports bridging the following Matter device types:

* On/Off Light
* Temperature Sensor
* Humidity Sensor

The application simulates the functionality of bridged devices by generating pseudorandom measurement results and changing the light state in a fixed time intervals.
The bridge supports adding and removing bridged devices dynamically at application runtime using commands from a dedicated Matter bridge shell module.

Remote testing in a network
===========================

By default, the Matter accessory device has no IPv6 network configured.
To use the device within a Wi-Fi network, you must pair it with the Matter controller over BluetoothÂ® LE to get the configuration from the controller.

The Bluetooth LE advertising starts automatically upon device startup, but only for a predefined period of time (15 minutes by default).
If the Bluetooth LE advertising times out, you can re-enable it manually by pressing **Button (SW2)**.

Additionally, the controller must get the `Onboarding information`_ from the Matter accessory device and provision the device into the network.
For details, see the `Testing`_ section.

.. _matter_bridge_app_build_types:

Matter bridge build types
=========================

The bridge application uses different configuration files depending on the supported features.
Configuration files are provided for different build types and they are located in the application root directory.

The :file:`prj.conf` file represents a ``debug`` build type.
Other build types are covered by dedicated files with the build type added as a suffix to the ``prj`` part, as per the following list.
For example, the ``release`` build type file name is :file:`prj_release.conf`.
If a board has other configuration files, for example associated with partition layout or child image configuration, these follow the same pattern.

.. include:: /config_and_build/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_overview_start
   :end-before: build_types_overview_end

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the build types supported by the sample.
This sample supports the following build types:

* ``debug`` -- Debug version of the application.
  You can use this version to enable additional features for verifying the application behavior, such as logs.
* ``release`` -- Release version of the application.
  You can use this version to enable only the necessary application functionalities to optimize its performance.

.. note::
    `Selecting a build type`_ is optional.
    The ``debug`` build type is used by default if no build type is explicitly selected.

Button 1:
     If pressed for six seconds, it initiates the factory reset of the device.
     Releasing the button within the six-second window cancels the factory reset procedure.

Button 2:
     Enables Bluetooth LE advertising for the predefined period of time (15 minutes by default), and makes the device discoverable over Bluetooth LE.

.. _matter_bridge_cli:

Matter CLI commands
===================

You can use the following commands to control the bridge device:

* For adding a new bridged device to the bridge:

   .. code-block:: console

      matter_bridge add <device_type> [node_label]

   This command adds a new bridged device to the bridge.
   In this command:

   * ``<device_type>`` is a Matter device type to use for the bridged device.
     The argument is mandatory and accepts the following values:

      * ``256`` - On/Off Light.
      * ``770`` - Temperature Sensor.
      * ``775`` - Humidity Sensor.

   * ``[node label]`` is a node label for the bridged device.
     The argument is optional and you can use it to better personalize the device in your application.

   For example:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      uart:~$ matter_bridge add 256 "Kitchen Light"

   You should be able to see the following output on the terminal:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         I: Adding OnOff Light bridged device
         I: Added device to dynamic endpoint 3 (index=0)

* For removing a bridged device from the bridge:

   .. code-block:: console

      matter_bridge remove <bridged_device_endpoint_id>

   This command removes a bridged device from the bridge.
   In this command:

      * ``<bridged_device_endpoint_id>`` is the endpoint ID of the bridged device to be removed.

   For example:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      uart:~$ matter_bridge remove 3

Selecting a build type
======================

Before you start testing the application, you can select one of the :ref:`matter_bridge_app_build_types`, depending on your building method.

Selecting a build type in |VSC|
-------------------------------

.. include:: /config_and_build/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_selection_vsc_start
   :end-before: build_types_selection_vsc_end

Selecting a build type from command line
----------------------------------------

.. include:: /config_and_build/modifying.rst
   :start-after: build_types_selection_cmd_start
   :end-before: For example, you can replace the

For example, you can replace the *selected_build_type* variable to build the ``release`` firmware for ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` by running the following command in the project directory:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -d build_nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONF_FILE=prj_release.conf

The ``build_nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` parameter specifies the output directory for the build files.

.. note::
   If the selected board does not support the selected build type, the build is interrupted.
   For example, if the ``shell`` build type is not supported by the selected board, the following notification appears:

   .. code-block:: console

      File not found: ./ncs/nrf/applications/matter_bridge/configuration/nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp/prj_shell.conf

Testing
=======

After building the sample and programming it to your development kit, complete the following steps to test its basic features:

#. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal_ANSI|
#. Observe that the **LED1** starts flashing (short flash on).
   This means that the sample has automatically started the Bluetooth LE advertising.
#. Commission the device to the Matter network.
   See `Commissioning the device`_ for more information.
   During the commissioning process, write down the value for the bridge node ID.
   This is going to be used in the next steps (*<bridge_node_ID>*).
#. Using the terminal emulator connected to the bridge, run the following :ref:`Matter CLI command <matter_bridge_cli>` to add a new bridged device:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      uart:~$ matter_bridge add <device_type>

   The *<device_type>* is a Matter device type that will be used to represent a new bridged device in the Matter Data Model.
   The following values are currently supported:

   * ``256`` - On/Off Light
   * ``770`` - Temperature Sensor
   * ``775`` - Humidity Sensor

   For example, if you want to add a new bridged device that will be exposed as an On/Off Light endpoint, use the following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      uart:~$ matter_bridge add 256

   You should be able to see the following output on the terminal:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      I: Adding OnOff Light bridged device
      I: Added device to dynamic endpoint 3 (index=0)

   Write down the value for the bridged device dynamic endpoint ID.
   This is going to be used in the next steps (*<bridged_device_endpoint_ID>*).

#. Use the :doc:`CHIP Tool <matter:chip_tool_guide>` to read the value of an attribute from the bridged device endpoint.
   For example, read the value of the *on-off* attribute from the *onoff* cluster using a following command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      ./chip-tool onoff read on-off <bridge_node_ID> <bridged_device_endpoint_ID>

Enabling remote control
=======================

Remote control allows you to control the Matter bridge device from a Wi-Fi network.

`Commissioning the device`_ allows you to set up a testing environment and remotely control the sample over a Matter-enabled Wi-Fi network.

Commissioning the device
------------------------

.. note::
   Before starting the commissioning to Matter procedure, ensure that there is no other Bluetooth LE connection established with the device.

To commission the device, go to the :ref:`ug_matter_gs_testing` page and complete the steps for the Matter network environment and the Matter controller you want to use.
After choosing the configuration, the guide walks you through the following steps:

* Build and install the Matter controller.
* Commission the device.
* Send Matter commands that cover scenarios described in the `Testing`_ section.

If you are new to Matter, the recommended approach is to use :ref:`CHIP Tool for Linux or macOS <ug_matter_configuring_controller>`.

Onboarding information
----------------------

When you start the commissioning procedure, the controller must get the onboarding information from the Matter accessory device.
The onboarding information representation depends on your commissioner setup.

For this application, you can use one of the following :ref:`onboarding information formats <ug_matter_network_topologies_commissioning_onboarding_formats>` to provide the commissioner with the data payload that includes the device discriminator and the setup PIN code:

  .. list-table:: Bridge application onboarding information
     :header-rows: 1
